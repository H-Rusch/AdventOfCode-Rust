# Advent of Code
Solutions for the Advent of Code on my journey of learning the Rust programming language.

To run a day in a specific year execute `cargo run -p <crate_name> -- <day>` where `<crate_name>` is the name of a specific years' crate as specified in the root-`Cargo.toml`.

Inputs are autmatically downloaded the first time a day is executed. The program will not attempt to download the input again after caching it.
